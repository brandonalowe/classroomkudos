# Classroom Kudos

This is a webapp I built for my partner to help assist with behaviour management inside her year 3 classroom.

I am currently in the middle of rebuilding the app from a JavaScript implementation to TypeScript, utilising the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework, using [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) for end-to-end typesafe APIs; [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to help define database schema; [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for CSS framework, and [@shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) styled component library.

Currently a work in progress!

- [x] Demo app
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Migrate existing noSQL database $\rightarrow$ SQL 
- [ ] Rebuild WebApp portion
- [ ] Develop rest of Web pages
